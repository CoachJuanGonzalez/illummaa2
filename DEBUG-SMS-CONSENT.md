# üîç DEBUG: SMS Consent Missing from Payload

**Issue:** You checked the SMS consent box, but `sms_consent` is missing from the webhook payload.

---

## üéØ Possible Causes

### 1. **Replit Code Not Updated** (Most Likely)
Your local code has the fix (commit 1847f1c from 21:00:24), but Replit might still be running the OLD code from before the fix.

**Test timestamp:** 21:03:38 (only 3 minutes after fix was committed)
**Possible:** Replit hadn't finished redeploying yet

### 2. **Form Not Sending consentSMS**
The checkbox state might not be reaching the backend.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Replit Console Logs

Look for this debug log in Replit console:
```
üîç [BACKEND DEBUG] Raw data received:
```

You should see: `consentSMS: 'true'` or `consentSMS: true`

**If you see:**
- ‚ùå `consentSMS: undefined` ‚Üí Form is NOT sending it
- ‚ùå `consentSMS: false` ‚Üí Form is sending false (you didn't check the box)
- ‚úÖ `consentSMS: 'true'` ‚Üí Form IS sending it, backend should process it

### Step 2: Check Browser DevTools Console

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Submit the form
4. Look for: `Consent values:`

You should see:
```javascript
Consent values: {
  consentSMS: 'true',
  timestamp: '2025-10-04T...',
  allConsents: {
    communications: 'true',
    sms: 'true',    // ‚Üê Should be 'true' if you checked it
    privacy: 'true',
    age: 'true'
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Check Network Tab Payload

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Submit the form
4. Click on `/api/submit-assessment` request
5. Go to "Payload" tab
6. Look for `consentSMS`

**Expected:** `consentSMS: "true"` or `consentSMS: true`

## ‚ùì What to Tell Me

After testing, please tell me:

1. **Did you check the SMS consent box?** (Yes/No)
2. **What do you see in browser console?** (`consentSMS: 'true'` or `'false'`?)
3. **What do you see in Network tab payload?** (Does it have `consentSMS`?)
4. **What do you see in Replit console logs?** (Any debug messages?)

This will help me figure out exactly where the data is being lost!
