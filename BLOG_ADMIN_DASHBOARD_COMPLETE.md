## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
client/src/
├── components/
│   ├── AdminGuard.tsx           # Authentication wrapper
│   └── CloudinaryUpload.tsx     # Image upload component
├── pages/
│   └── admin/
│       ├── index.tsx            # Protected route wrappers
│       ├── BlogAdmin.tsx        # Post management dashboard
│       └── BlogPostEditor.tsx   # WYSIWYG editor page
└── App.tsx                      # Admin routes added

server/
└── routes.ts                    # Admin password verification route added
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User visits `/admin/blog`
2. AdminGuard checks `sessionStorage` for `admin_auth` token
3. If not authenticated, show login form
4. Submit password to `/api/admin/verify-password`
5. Backend validates against `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env variable
6. On success, store token and render admin interface
7. Session expires when browser closes

### Data Flow

**Create/Edit Post:**
```
BlogPostEditor → API (POST/PUT /api/blog/posts) → Database → Success
```

**List Posts:**
```
BlogAdmin → API (GET /api/blog/posts) → Database → Render Table
```

**Delete Post:**
```
BlogAdmin → API (DELETE /api/blog/posts/:id) → Database → Refresh List
```

## Security

### Authentication

**Method:** Simple password-based authentication

**Storage:**
- Password stored in `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Never commit password to Git
- Use strong, unique password in production

**Session:**
- Authenticated state stored in `sessionStorage`
- Expires when browser is closed
- Not persisted to disk

**Rate Limiting:**
- Maximum 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Implemented at backend level

### Recommendations for Production

**1. Upgrade to Stronger Authentication:**
```typescript
// Consider implementing:
- OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub)
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
```

**2. Add HTTPS:**
```typescript
// Ensure all admin routes use HTTPS
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Set secure cookie flags
- Enable HSTS headers
```

**3. Audit Logging:**
```typescript
// Track admin actions:
- Login attempts (success/failure)
- Post creation/edits/deletions
- Image uploads
- IP addresses and timestamps
```

**4. IP Whitelisting:**
```typescript
// Restrict admin access to known IPs
const allowedIPs = ['your.office.ip', 'your.home.ip'];
if (!allowedIPs.includes(req.ip)) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
}
```
