## 🎯 ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXES

### Issue 1: Icon Background Squares Missing/Invisible

**Current State (Verified):**
```tsx
// Line 29-30: Cost Efficiency
<div className="w-16 h-16 bg-primary/10 rounded-2xl flex items-center justify-center mb-6">
  <DollarSign className="text-primary" size={32} />
</div>

// Line 41-42: Speed of Construction
<div className="w-16 h-16 bg-accent/10 rounded-2xl flex items-center justify-center mb-6">
  <Zap className="text-accent" size={32} />
</div>

// Line 77: Sustainability (mobile centered)
<div className="w-16 h-16 bg-green-100 rounded-2xl flex items-center justify-center mb-6 mx-auto md:mx-0">
```

**Problem:**
- `bg-primary/10` and `bg-accent/10` use 10% opacity → nearly invisible background squares
- Other cards use solid colors like `bg-blue-100`, `bg-orange-100`, `bg-green-100`
- `mx-auto` centers Sustainability icon on mobile instead of left-aligning

### Issue 2: Required Asterisks Missing

**Current State (Verified):**
```tsx
// Line 2103: CASL - HAS asterisk ✅
I consent to CASL compliance (Required for SMS) <span className="text-red-500">*</span>

// Line 2122: SMS consent - MISSING asterisk ❌
I consent to receive SMS text messages from ILLUMMAA for time-sensitive updates and project coordination. (Required for SMS compliance)

// Line 2145: Privacy Policy - MISSING asterisk ❌
{' '}(Required by PIPEDA)

// Line 2164: Age verification - MISSING asterisk ❌
I confirm that I am 18 years of age or older and have the legal capacity to provide consent
```

**Problem:**
- 3 out of 4 required checkboxes missing red asterisk visual indicator
- Inconsistent UX - users can't easily identify which fields are mandatory

Fix icon background squares and required asterisks in assessment form

ISSUES:

ISSUE 1: Icon Background Squares Missing
In the "Why Partner with ILLUMMAA" section, two cards have missing or invisible icon background squares:
1. Cost Efficiency ($) - background square not visible
2. Speed of Construction (⚡) - background square not visible

Meanwhile, these cards have proper visible background squares:
✅ Consistency and Quality Control (shield) - blue background
✅ Flexibility and Customization (gear) - orange background
✅ Sustainability (leaf) - green background

On mobile, the Sustainability card icon is centered instead of aligned left like the others.

ISSUE 2: Required Asterisks Missing
In the "Legal Consent & Privacy" section of the assessment form, three REQUIRED checkboxes are missing red asterisk (*) visual indicators:
1. "I consent to receive SMS text messages..." (Required for SMS compliance) - Missing *
2. "I have read and accept the Privacy Policy" (Required by PIPEDA) - Missing *
3. "I confirm that I am 18 years of age or older..." - Missing *

Meanwhile, the first checkbox "I consent to CASL compliance" correctly shows the red asterisk.

ROOT CAUSE:
- Cost Efficiency uses bg-primary/10 (opacity-based, nearly invisible)
- Speed of Construction uses bg-accent/10 (opacity-based, nearly invisible)
- Sustainability icon has mx-auto which centers it on mobile
- Three required checkboxes missing <span className="text-red-500">*</span> in their labels

FIX:
1. Change to solid background colors like the other cards and fix alignment
2. Add red asterisk (*) to all three required consent checkboxes
