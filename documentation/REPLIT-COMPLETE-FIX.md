# 🔧 COMPLETE FIX - PDF Display + Replace 2D Floor Plan

## 🎯 THREE ISSUES TO FIX:

1. ❌ **Extra button click** - Users have to click "Open Floor Plan PDF" button
2. ❌ **Architect contact info visible** - Right side of PDF shows architect details
3. ❌ **Wrong "2D Floor Plan" image** - Currently shows exterior rendering, should show GROUND FLOOR PLAN

---

## ✅ COMPLETE SOLUTION (ALL 3 ISSUES FIXED)

This guide fixes everything in one go!

---

## 📋 STEP 1: INSTALL PYTHON LIBRARIES (LOCAL COMPUTER)

**Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and run:**

```bash
pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
```

**OR if that doesn't work:**

```bash
python -m pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
```

**OR try:**

```bash
py -m pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
```

---

## 📋 STEP 2: RUN PYTHON SCRIPT (LOCAL COMPUTER)

**Navigate to project folder:**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Juan Gonzalez\Documents\PVRPOSE AI\ILLUMMAA\illummaa-github"
```

**Run the extraction script:**

```bash
python extract_and_crop_technical_plans.py
```

**OR if python doesn't work, try:**

```bash
py extract_and_crop_technical_plans.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```

Fix 3 issues: (1) Embed technical plans directly, (2) Remove architect contact info, (3) Replace "2D Floor Plan" with GROUND FLOOR PLAN

TASK OVERVIEW:
1. Upload 6 high-quality JPG images (1400px, 300 DPI, architect info removed)
2. Replace current "2D Floor Plan" image with GROUND FLOOR PLAN from PDF
3. Add 6 technical plan tabs (Cover, Floor Plan, Elevations, Foundation, Roof)
4. Remove PDF button - images display immediately

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: UPLOAD 6 JPG FILES TO REPLIT

Create folder: attached_assets/3br-technical-plans/

Upload these 6 files (I will provide them):
1. cover-page.jpg
2. floor-plan-main.jpg          ← THIS IS THE GROUND FLOOR PLAN
3. elevations-front-rear.jpg
4. elevations-left-right.jpg
5. foundation-plan.jpg
6. roof-framing-plan.jpg

All images: 1400px width, 300 DPI, 100% quality, RGB, architect info removed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 2: UPDATE model-3br-executive.tsx

FILE: client/src/pages/model-3br-executive.tsx

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CHANGE #1: Replace imports (around line 8-13)

FIND:
import exteriorImage from "@assets/3bedroom-1_1757890999523.jpg";
import interiorImage from "@assets/3bedroom-2_1757891004660.jpg";
import floorPlanImage from "@assets/3bedroom-3_1757891009839.jpg";

// PDF path for technical plans
const technicalPlansPDF = "/attached_assets/3-bedroom-technical-plans_1759503916090.pdf";

REPLACE WITH:
import exteriorImage from "@assets/3bedroom-1_1757890999523.jpg";
import interiorImage from "@assets/3bedroom-2_1757891004660.jpg";

// Technical plan images (1400px, 300 DPI, architect info removed)
import floorPlanImage from "@assets/3br-technical-plans/floor-plan-main.jpg";
import techCoverPage from "@assets/3br-technical-plans/cover-page.jpg";
import techElevationsFR from "@assets/3br-technical-plans/elevations-front-rear.jpg";
import techElevationsLR from "@assets/3br-technical-plans/elevations-left-right.jpg";
import techFoundation from "@assets/3br-technical-plans/foundation-plan.jpg";
import techRoofFraming from "@assets/3br-technical-plans/roof-framing-plan.jpg";

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CHANGE #2: Update FloorPlanViewer floorPlans array (around line 290-315)

FIND:
floorPlans={[
  {
    id: "2d",
    title: "2D Floor Plan",
    type: "2d",
    imageUrl: floorPlanImage,
  },
  {
    id: "technical",
    title: "Technical Plans (PDF)",
    type: "2d",
    pdfUrl: technicalPlansPDF,
  },
  {
    id: "3d",
    title: "3D Isometric View",
    type: "3d",
  },
  {
    id: "dimensions",
    title: "Dimensions & Layout",
    type: "dimensions",
  },
]}

REPLACE WITH:
floorPlans={[
  {
    id: "ground-floor",
    title: "Ground Floor Plan",
    type: "2d",
    imageUrl: floorPlanImage,
  },
  {
    id: "cover",
    title: "Cover Page",
    type: "2d",
    imageUrl: techCoverPage,
  },
  {
    id: "elevations-fr",
    title: "Elevations (Front/Rear)",
    type: "2d",
    imageUrl: techElevationsFR,
  },
  {
    id: "elevations-lr",
    title: "Elevations (Left/Right)",
    type: "2d",
    imageUrl: techElevationsLR,
  },
  {
    id: "foundation",
    title: "Foundation Plan",
    type: "2d",
    imageUrl: techFoundation,
  },
  {
    id: "roof",
    title: "Roof Framing",
    type: "2d",
    imageUrl: techRoofFraming,
  },
  {
    id: "3d",
    title: "3D Isometric View",
    type: "3d",
  },
  {
    id: "dimensions",
    title: "Dimensions & Layout",
    type: "dimensions",
  },
]}

VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. TypeScript compiles without errors
2. Build succeeds (npm run build)
3. Navigate to /models/3br-executive
4. Click "Ground Floor Plan" tab - should show GROUND FLOOR PLAN immediately
5. Click "Cover Page" tab - should show cover page
6. Click "Elevations (Front/Rear)" - should show elevations
7. All images should appear IMMEDIATELY (no button click)
8. No architect contact info visible on any image
9. All images are high quality (1400px, 300 DPI)
10. Zoom controls work on all technical plan tabs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT THIS FIXES:

✅ Issue #1: Images appear immediately (no "Open Floor Plan PDF" button)
✅ Issue #2: Architect contact info removed (300px cropped from right)
✅ Issue #3: "Ground Floor Plan" tab shows correct GROUND FLOOR PLAN image

BEFORE:
- "2D Floor Plan" showed wrong image (exterior rendering?)
- "Technical Plans (PDF)" required extra button click
- Architect contact info visible

AFTER:
- "Ground Floor Plan" shows correct GROUND FLOOR PLAN
- 6 technical plan tabs appear immediately when clicked
- Architect contact info completely removed
- All images optimized: 1400px width, 300 DPI, 100% quality

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SECURITY: ✅ NO CHANGES
All existing security measures maintained.

RISK: 🟢 LOW (image swap only, no backend changes)

BREAKING CHANGES: ❌ NONE
Old images replaced, functionality enhanced.
```

## 📊 WHAT GETS FIXED:

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Wrong 2D image | Shows exterior/other image | ✅ Shows GROUND FLOOR PLAN |
| Extra button click | Green card with button | ✅ Image appears immediately |
| Architect info | Visible on right side | ✅ Completely removed (300px cropped) |

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING:

**"Folder not found" error:**
- Make sure you ran the Python script first
- Check folder exists: `dir "attached_assets\3br-technical-plans"`

**"Python not found" error:**
Try these alternatives:
```bash
python extract_and_crop_technical_plans.py
py extract_and_crop_technical_plans.py
python3 extract_and_crop_technical_plans.py
```

**"Module not found" error:**
Install libraries:
```bash
pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
python -m pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
py -m pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
```

**Images don't appear in Replit:**
- Make sure all 6 JPG files are uploaded to `attached_assets/3br-technical-plans/`
- Check file names match exactly (lowercase, hyphens, .jpg extension)

---

## ✅ SUMMARY:

**You need to:**
1. ✅ Install Python libraries: `pip install PyMuPDF Pillow`
2. ✅ Run script: `python extract_and_crop_technical_plans.py`
3. ✅ Upload 6 JPG files to Replit (`attached_assets/3br-technical-plans/` folder)
4. ✅ Paste the Replit prompt above into Replit AI chat

**Result:**
- ✅ Ground Floor Plan shows correct image
- ✅ 6 technical plan tabs display immediately (no button)
- ✅ Architect contact info removed
- ✅ Maximum quality images (1400px, 300 DPI, 100%)
