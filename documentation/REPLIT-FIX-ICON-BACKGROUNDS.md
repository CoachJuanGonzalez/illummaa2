# 🔧 REPLIT FIX - Icon Backgrounds & Required Asterisks

**Issues:**
1. Cost Efficiency ($) and Speed of Construction (⚡) icons are missing visible background squares
2. Sustainability icon not aligned left on mobile
3. Three required consent checkboxes are missing red asterisk (*) visual indicators

**Root Cause:**
1. Using `bg-primary/10` and `bg-accent/10` (opacity-based colors) instead of solid color backgrounds
2. Sustainability icon has `mx-auto` on mobile which centers it instead of aligning left
3. Required consent checkboxes show "(Required...)" text but missing red asterisk visual indicator

**Solution:** Change to solid background colors, fix alignment, and add red asterisks to all required consent checkboxes.

Fix icon background squares and required asterisks in assessment form

ISSUES:

ISSUE 1: Icon Background Squares Missing
In the "Why Partner with ILLUMMAA" section, two cards have missing or invisible icon background squares:
1. Cost Efficiency ($) - background square not visible
2. Speed of Construction (⚡) - background square not visible

Meanwhile, these cards have proper visible background squares:
✅ Consistency and Quality Control (shield) - blue background
✅ Flexibility and Customization (gear) - orange background
✅ Sustainability (leaf) - green background

On mobile, the Sustainability card icon is centered instead of aligned left like the others.

ISSUE 2: Required Asterisks Missing
In the "Legal Consent & Privacy" section of the assessment form, three REQUIRED checkboxes are missing red asterisk (*) visual indicators:
1. "I consent to receive SMS text messages..." (Required for SMS compliance) - Missing *
2. "I have read and accept the Privacy Policy" (Required by PIPEDA) - Missing *
3. "I confirm that I am 18 years of age or older..." - Missing *

Meanwhile, the first checkbox "I consent to CASL compliance" correctly shows the red asterisk.

ROOT CAUSE:
- Cost Efficiency uses bg-primary/10 (opacity-based, nearly invisible)
- Speed of Construction uses bg-accent/10 (opacity-based, nearly invisible)
- Sustainability icon has mx-auto which centers it on mobile
- Three required checkboxes missing <span className="text-red-500">*</span> in their labels

FIX:
1. Change to solid background colors like the other cards and fix alignment
2. Add red asterisk (*) to all three required consent checkboxes
