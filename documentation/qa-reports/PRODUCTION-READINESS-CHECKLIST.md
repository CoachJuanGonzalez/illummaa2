export NODE_ENV=production

# Verify environment
echo $NODE_ENV
# Expected output: production
```

### Step 2: Build Application

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd illummaa-github

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run TypeScript check
npm run check

# Build for production
npm run build
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ built in [time]
✓ 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

### Step 3: Verify Build Artifacts

```bash
# Check dist folder exists
ls -la dist/

# Verify key files
# - dist/index.js (server bundle)
# - dist/assets/* (client assets)
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

**Required Environment Variables:**

```env
# Production settings
NODE_ENV=production

# Database (if applicable)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# GoHighLevel Webhook
GOHIGHLEVEL_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url

# Optional: Google Analytics
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_ga_id
```

**Verify:**
```bash
# Check .env file exists
ls -la .env

# Do NOT commit .env to git
cat .gitignore | grep .env
```

### Step 5: Security Headers Check

**Verify Helmet Configuration:**

- [x] ✅ HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security): 31536000s
- [x] ✅ X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- [x] ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] ✅ X-XSS-Protection: enabled

**Location:** `server/routes.ts:212-241`

### Step 6: Start Production Server

```bash
# Start production server
npm run start

# Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-03T...","environment":"production"}
```

### Step 7: Smoke Testing

**Test Critical Paths:**

1. **Homepage loads:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-domain.com
   # Expected: 200 OK
   ```

2. **Assessment form accessible:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-domain.com/#developer-qualification
   # Expected: 200 OK
   ```

3. **API health check:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   # Expected: {"status":"healthy",...}
   ```

4. **Form submission (manual test):**
   - Open browser → Navigate to site
   - Fill assessment form (Steps 1-5)
   - Verify submission success
   - Check GoHighLevel for webhook delivery

- [ ] Mobile usability (target: no issues reported)

**Logs to Watch:**
```bash
# Monitor application logs
tail -f logs/application.log | grep ERROR

# Monitor webhook failures
tail -f logs/webhook.log | grep FAILED
```

### Week 1: Performance Baseline

**Track These KPIs:**

   - High (major functionality broken): Rollback within 1 hour
   - Medium (minor issues): Fix forward if possible
   - Low (cosmetic): Document for next release

2. **Rollback Procedure:**
   ```bash
   # Stop production server
   pm2 stop illummaa

   # Checkout previous stable version
   git checkout [previous-stable-tag]

   # Rebuild
   npm run build

   # Restart server
   pm2 start illummaa

   # Verify rollback
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   ```
