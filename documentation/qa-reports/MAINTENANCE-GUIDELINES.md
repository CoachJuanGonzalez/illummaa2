## üö® REACTIVE MAINTENANCE

### When Users Report Issues

**Step 1: Triage (5 minutes)**

**Severity Classification:**

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Example |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| üî¥ Critical | Site down, security breach | Immediate (<15 min) | 500 errors, data breach |
| üü† High | Major feature broken | <1 hour | Form won't submit |
| üü° Medium | Minor feature broken | <4 hours | Link doesn't work |
| üü¢ Low | Cosmetic issue | <24 hours | Typo, color issue |

**Step 2: Investigation**

```bash
# Check logs for user's timeframe
grep "ERROR" logs/application.log | grep "[timestamp-range]"

# Check specific user's submission
grep "[user-email]" logs/submission.log

# Review webhook delivery
grep "[submission-id]" logs/webhook.log
```

**Step 3: Fix Strategy**

**CRITICAL (üî¥): Immediate Rollback**
```bash
# Stop current version
pm2 stop illummaa

# Rollback to last stable
git checkout [last-stable-tag]
npm run build
pm2 start illummaa

# Notify stakeholders
# Plan permanent fix separately
```

**HIGH (üü†): Hotfix Branch**
```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/[issue-description]

# Make minimal fix
# Test thoroughly
# Deploy when verified

# Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/[issue-description]
```

**MEDIUM/LOW (üü°üü¢): Standard Process**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b fix/[issue-description]

# Implement fix
# Add tests (if applicable)
# Review with team
# Deploy in next release window
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è COMMON MAINTENANCE TASKS

### Task 1: Update Dependencies

**When to Do:**
- Monthly: Security patches only
- Quarterly: Minor version updates
- Annually: Major version updates (with testing)

**How to Do:**
```bash
# Check outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update security patches (safe)
npm audit fix --only=prod

# Update minor versions (test first)
npm update --save

# NEVER update major versions without testing
# Example: react@18 ‚Üí react@19 requires full QA
```

**Rollback if issues:**
```bash
git checkout package.json package-lock.json
npm install
```

---

### Task 2: Database Maintenance (if applicable)

**Weekly:**
```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT table_name, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(table_name::regclass))
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Monitor query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE [slow-query];
```

**Monthly:**
```sql
-- Vacuum and analyze
VACUUM ANALYZE;

-- Reindex if needed
REINDEX DATABASE [database-name];
```

---

### Task 3: Log Rotation

**Setup (one-time):**
```bash
# /etc/logrotate.d/illummaa
/var/log/illummaa/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 30
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0644 www-data www-data
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        systemctl reload illummaa
    endscript
}
```

**Verify:**
```bash
# Force rotation test
logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/illummaa

# Check rotated logs
ls -lh /var/log/illummaa/
```

---

### Task 4: SSL Certificate Renewal

**Auto-renewal with Let's Encrypt:**
```bash
# Verify auto-renewal
certbot renew --dry-run

# Check certificate expiry
openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
```

**Manual renewal (if needed):**
```bash
certbot renew --force-renewal
systemctl reload nginx  # or your web server
```

---

## üîç MONITORING & ALERTS

---

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO DO

### ‚ùå NEVER DO THESE:

1. **‚ùå Don't chase 100/100 score**
   - Current 95/100 is excellent
   - Risk of breaking > reward of perfection
   - Focus on real issues, not metrics

2. **‚ùå Don't refactor working code**
   - "Clean code" is subjective
   - Working code is precious
   - Refactor only when absolutely necessary

3. **‚ùå Don't update major dependencies without testing**
   - Major version updates = breaking changes
   - Always test in staging first
   - Have rollback plan ready

4. **‚ùå Don't deploy on Fridays**
   - Issues discovered over weekend
   - Support team unavailable
   - Deploy Monday-Thursday only

5. **‚ùå Don't make multiple changes at once**
   - Change one thing at a time
   - Easier to identify issues
   - Easier to rollback

6. **‚ùå Don't skip backups before changes**
   - Always backup before updates
   - Verify backup is restorable
   - Document rollback procedure

---

## ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES

### DO THESE:

1. **‚úÖ Version Control Everything**
   ```bash
   # Tag releases
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Production release 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0

   # Meaningful commit messages
   git commit -m "Fix: Assessment form submission timeout (issue #123)"
   ```

2. **‚úÖ Document All Changes**
   ```markdown
   # CHANGELOG.md

   ## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-15
   ### Fixed
   - Assessment form timeout on slow connections
   - Mobile header z-index issue

   ### Changed
   - Updated libphonenumber-js to 1.12.24
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Test Before Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Pre-deployment checklist
   npm run check        # TypeScript
   npm run build        # Build succeeds
   curl [staging]/api/health  # Health check
   # Manual form submission test
   # Browser compatibility spot check
   ```

4. **‚úÖ Monitor After Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Post-deployment monitoring (first 24 hours)
   tail -f logs/error.log     # Watch for errors
   watch -n 60 'curl [url]/api/health'  # Health checks
   # Check form submissions in GoHighLevel
   ```

5. **‚úÖ Keep Dependencies Updated (Gradually)**
   ```bash
   # Monthly security patches
   npm audit fix --only=prod

   # Quarterly minor updates
   npm update --save

   # Annual major updates (with full testing)
   # Plan 1-2 week testing period
   ```
