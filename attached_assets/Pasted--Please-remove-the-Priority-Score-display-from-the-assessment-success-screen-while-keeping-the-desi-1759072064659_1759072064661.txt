  Please remove the Priority Score display from the assessment success screen while keeping the design beautiful and well-balanced.        
  Here are the exact changes:

  **FILE TO MODIFY:**
  client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx

  **CHANGES NEEDED:**

  **1. REMOVE PRIORITY SCORE SECTION**

  Find the "Assessment Results Card" section (around line 923-968) and make these changes:

  **STEP 1: Change grid from 3 columns to 2 columns**

  CHANGE LINE 925 FROM:
  ```tsx
  <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">

  CHANGE TO:
  <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 max-w-2xl mx-auto">

  Why: Changes from 3 columns to 2 columns and centers the remaining cards with better spacing (gap-12 instead of gap-8) and max-width     
  for optimal layout.

  STEP 2: Remove the entire Priority Score section

  REMOVE LINES 940-954 (the complete Priority Score div):
                  {/* Priority Score */}
                  <div className="text-center">
                    <div className="inline-flex items-center justify-center w-16 h-16 bg-blue-100 rounded-full mb-3">
                      <svg className="w-8 h-8 text-blue-600" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
                        <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M13 7h8m0 0v8m0-8l-8 8-4-4-6 6" />
                      </svg>
                    </div>
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Priority Score</h3>
                    <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600" data-testid="priority-score">
                      {priorityScore}/150
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
                      {getResponseCommitmentLevel(customerTier)}
                    </p>
                  </div>

  DELETE this entire section completely.

  2. WHAT TO KEEP (DO NOT MODIFY):

  ✅ Keep "Partnership Tier" section (lines 927-938) - LEFT SIDE
  ✅ Keep "Compliance" section (lines 956-966) - RIGHT SIDE
  ✅ Keep all other success screen elements (What's Next, Contact Information, etc.)

  3. RESULT AFTER CHANGES:

  The success screen will display a beautifully balanced 2-column layout:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │              Assessment Complete!                        │
  │   Comprehensive partnership resources and support       │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  ┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
  │  📚                  │              ✓                   │
  │  Partnership Tier    │         Compliance              │
  │  Explorer            │  CASL & PIPEDA Verified         │
  │  Partnership         │  Enterprise-grade privacy       │
  │  resources...        │  compliance                     │
  └──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘

  4. UX/UI IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED:

  ✅ Better spacing: gap-12 (was gap-8) - more breathing room between cards
  ✅ Centered layout: max-w-2xl mx-auto - cards are centered on the page
  ✅ Balanced design: 2 equal columns instead of 3 uneven columns
  ✅ Mobile responsive: Stacks to single column on mobile (md:grid-cols-2)
  ✅ Professional appearance: Clean, symmetrical, B2B-focused

  5. BACKEND NOTE:

  The priority score calculation (priorityScore variable) will still run in the background for internal use (CRM, routing, sales team      
  prioritization). This change only removes the user-facing display of the numerical score, which is not relevant for B2B partnerships.    

  6. ACCESSIBILITY:

  ✅ Maintains data-testid attributes for testing
  ✅ Preserves semantic HTML structure
  ✅ No impact on screen readers
  ✅ Mobile-first responsive design maintained

  SUMMARY:

  This removes the "Priority Score" card (with trending arrow icon, "25/150" number, and "Partnership Support Track" subtitle) while       
  keeping the two important cards: Partnership Tier and Compliance status. The remaining cards are centered and beautifully spaced for     
  optimal UX/UI design.

  NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED - This is a surgical removal that maintains all existing functionality and improves the visual balance of the    
   success screen.

  **What this does:**

  🎯 **Removes:** Priority Score section (icon, "25/150", "Partnership Support Track")

  ✅ **Keeps:** Partnership Tier (left) + Compliance (right)

  🎨 **Improves UX/UI:**
  - 2-column centered layout (was 3-column)
  - Better spacing (gap-12 vs gap-8)
  - Max-width for optimal viewing
  - Mobile responsive
  - Professional & balanced design

  The priority score will still be calculated in the background for your CRM/sales team use, but won't be shown to users
  (B2B-appropriate).
