# Replit Blog Infrastructure Feasibility Assessment

## Project Overview
I need to **assess the feasibility** of integrating a complete blog infrastructure into an existing B2B modular housing website (ILLUMMAA) and want to understand if Replit can handle the full technical stack.

**IMPORTANT:**
- This is a **FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT REQUEST ONLY** - I'm asking for recommendations and guidance on **how** this could be implemented, not requesting implementation yet.
- **DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANY CODE** - I only want detailed analysis, recommendations, and implementation guidance.
- This would NOT be a standalone blog project. This would be a blog section added to an existing production website.
- I want to understand the technical approach, limitations, costs, and implementation roadmap before proceeding.
- **I will implement the code myself after reviewing your feasibility assessment.**

### Existing Website Infrastructure

**Current Production Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.6.3, Vite 5.4.20, Wouter 3.3.5 (SPA routing)
- **Backend:** Express 4.21.2 + Node.js (ES modules)
- **Database:** Neon serverless PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM 0.39.1
- **UI Framework:** Radix UI (18 components) + Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- **Deployment:** Replit-compatible (with `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer` plugin)
- **Alternative Deployment:** Railway (app platform)

**Current Routes (Language-Prefixed Structure):**
```tsx
{/* Language-prefixed routes (PRIMARY) */}
<Route path="/:lang(en|fr)/" component={Home} />
<Route path="/:lang(en|fr)/models/1br-compact" component={Model1BRCompact} />
<Route path="/:lang(en|fr)/models/2br-family" component={Model2BRFamily} />
<Route path="/:lang(en|fr)/models/3br-executive" component={Model3BRExecutive} />

{/* Legacy routes without language prefix (redirects to /en) */}
<Route path="/" component={Home} />
<Route path="/models/1br-compact" component={Model1BRCompact} />
<Route path="/models/2br-family" component={Model2BRFamily} />
<Route path="/models/3br-executive" component={Model3BRExecutive} />

{/* 404 - catch-all */}
<Route component={NotFound} />
```

## üö® TECH STACK CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT DEVIATE)

**CRITICAL:** The following technologies are ALREADY WORKING in production. **DO NOT recommend alternatives or suggest migrations.** Your feasibility assessment must work WITHIN these constraints.

### **‚úÖ LOCKED TECHNOLOGIES (Must Use):**

**Database:**
- ‚úÖ **Neon PostgreSQL** (already provisioned, connected via DATABASE_URL)
- ‚úÖ **Drizzle ORM 0.39.1** (NOT Prisma, NOT TypeORM, NOT Sequelize)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER suggest switching to:** Prisma, TypeORM, MongoDB, Firebase, Supabase

**Router:**
- ‚úÖ **Wouter 3.3.5** (NOT Next.js App Router, NOT React Router, NOT Remix)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER suggest switching to:** Next.js, Remix, TanStack Router, React Router v6

**Build Tool:**
- ‚úÖ **Vite 5.4.20** (NOT Next.js, NOT Webpack, NOT Turbopack)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER suggest switching to:** Next.js, Create React App, Webpack

**Internationalization:**
- ‚úÖ **i18next 25.6.0 + react-i18next 16.0.1** (fully configured, working)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER suggest:** Rebuilding i18n from scratch, using next-i18next, or other i18n libraries

**UI Framework:**
- ‚úÖ **Radix UI (25 components) + Tailwind CSS 3.4.17** (design system established)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER suggest switching to:** Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap

**Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ **Replit-compatible** (with `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer` plugin)
- ‚úÖ **Railway** (alternative deployment option)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER suggest:** Vercel (Next.js-optimized), Netlify (JAMstack focus)

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Why These Constraints Exist**

**If you recommend Prisma instead of Drizzle:**
- ‚ùå Would require rewriting entire database layer (40+ files)
- ‚ùå Would break existing assessment form, AI scoring, analytics
- ‚ùå Would cause 2-3 weeks of migration work + testing
- ‚ùå Would introduce risk to production-critical lead generation system

**If you recommend Next.js instead of Wouter:**
- ‚ùå Would require complete application rewrite (entire frontend)
- ‚ùå Would break existing routing, analytics tracking, session management
- ‚ùå Would require migrating from Vite to Next.js build system
- ‚ùå Would cause 4-6 weeks of migration work + QA regression testing

**If you recommend rebuilding i18n:**
- ‚ùå Existing i18next setup is fully configured and working
- ‚ùå Would waste time rebuilding what already exists
- ‚ùå Would introduce bugs in existing bilingual functionality

### **‚úÖ CORRECT: Focus Your Recommendations On**

1. **Blog-specific additions** (rich text editor, image storage, admin auth)
2. **Schema extensions** (how to add blog tables via Drizzle migrations)
3. **Routing additions** (how to add `/blog` routes to existing Wouter router)
4. **Integration strategies** (how blog integrates with existing i18next, analytics, security)
5. **Performance optimizations** (code splitting blog routes separately)
6. **SEO implementations** (schema markup, meta tags, sitemap updates)

### **‚ùå INCORRECT: Do NOT Recommend**

1. ‚ùå "Migrate to Next.js for better SSR support"
2. ‚ùå "Use Prisma instead of Drizzle for easier schema management"
3. ‚ùå "Switch to React Router for more features"
4. ‚ùå "Move to Vercel for automatic deployments"
5. ‚ùå "Rebuild i18n with next-i18next for better performance"
6. ‚ùå "Consider Supabase for easier database management"

### **‚úÖ EXAMPLE: Correct Drizzle Syntax (NOT Prisma)**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT (Drizzle ORM syntax - this is what I'm using):
import { pgTable, text, uuid, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const posts = pgTable('posts', {
  id: uuid('id').primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  slug_en: text('slug_en').notNull().unique(),
  slug_fr: text('slug_fr').notNull().unique(),
  title_en: text('title_en').notNull(),
  title_fr: text('title_fr').notNull(),
  published_at: timestamp('published_at'),
});

// ‚ùå WRONG (Prisma syntax - DO NOT USE THIS):
model Post {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  slug_en    String   @unique
  slug_fr    String   @unique
  title_en   String
  title_fr   String
  publishedAt DateTime?
}
```

**If you provide Prisma syntax in your assessment, I cannot use it.** Please only provide Drizzle ORM code examples.

---

**üö® CRITICAL: BILINGUAL INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS**

**Your codebase ALREADY HAS complete bilingual (EN/FR) support:**
- ‚úÖ **i18next 25.6.0** + react-i18next 16.0.1 fully configured (`client/src/i18n.ts`)
- ‚úÖ **Language detection** implemented (localStorage ‚Üí navigator ‚Üí htmlTag ‚Üí path)
- ‚úÖ **All routes support** `/:lang(en|fr)/...` pattern
- ‚úÖ **Translation files exist:** `client/src/locales/en/translation.json` and `client/src/locales/fr-CA/translation.json`
- ‚úÖ **Language switcher infrastructure** in place

**If feasible, the blog would need to:**
1. ‚úÖ Follow existing routing pattern: `/:lang(en|fr)/blog/:slug`
2. ‚úÖ Integrate with existing i18n setup (import and use `useTranslation` hook)
3. ‚úÖ Add blog translations to existing translation.json files
4. ‚úÖ Use existing language detection (not rebuild it)
5. ‚úÖ Support legacy routes without language prefix (e.g., `/blog/:slug` ‚Üí redirect to `/en/blog/:slug`)

**Important: Should not:**
- ‚ùå Build new language detection system (i18next already configured)
- ‚ùå Create new i18n configuration (use existing setup)
- ‚ùå Implement hreflang tags from scratch (may already exist in Phase 1 SEO)

**Critical Requirements for Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Should integrate seamlessly with existing Wouter routing (language-prefixed pattern)
- ‚úÖ Should use existing i18next setup (not create new bilingual system)
- ‚úÖ Should use same database (Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)
- ‚úÖ Should maintain existing Replit compatibility
- ‚úÖ Should preserve existing security measures (Helmet, rate limiting, CSRF)
- ‚úÖ Should extend (not modify) Google Analytics 4 tracking (add blog events)
- ‚úÖ Should maintain WCAG AA accessibility compliance

**What This Means for Your Assessment:**
If the blog is feasible, it would need to:
1. Add new routes to existing Wouter router following `/:lang(en|fr)/blog/...` pattern
2. Extend existing Express backend with blog API endpoints
3. Use the same Neon PostgreSQL database (add new blog tables via Drizzle schema)
4. Integrate with existing i18next setup (useTranslation hook, existing translation files)
5. Integrate with existing Radix UI + Tailwind CSS design system
6. Work within the existing Vite build configuration
7. Maintain the same security and compliance standards
8. Extend existing analytics.ts with blog events (not modify existing code)

```

**How Language Toggle Works:**
1. User selects language (EN/FR) via language switcher
2. Frontend detects language from URL path (`/en/blog/...` or `/fr/blog/...`)
3. API fetches appropriate language fields from database:
   - If `/en/blog/slug` ‚Üí return `title_en`, `content_en`, `meta_description_en`, etc.
   - If `/fr/blog/slug` ‚Üí return `title_fr`, `content_fr`, `meta_description_fr`, etc.
4. Hreflang tags link EN/FR versions of same post
5. Language preference stored in cookie/localStorage for consistency

**Admin Panel Features:**
- CRUD operations for posts (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Rich text editor (TinyMCE, Quill, or similar)
- Image upload with drag-and-drop
- Category/tag management
- Post scheduling (publish at future date/time)
- Draft/publish workflow
- Preview functionality
- User role management (Admin, Editor, Author)

### SEO & Performance Requirements

**Technical SEO:**
- Dynamic meta titles/descriptions per post

## Questions for Replit

### 1. **Integration with Existing Stack**
**CRITICAL: How do I integrate blog functionality into the existing React + Express + Wouter + Drizzle stack?**

**Current Stack (MUST be preserved):**
- React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.6.3
- Wouter 3.3.5 for SPA routing (NO Next.js, NO Remix, NO SvelteKit)
- Express 4.21.2 backend
- Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM 0.39.1
- Vite 5.4.20 build tool
- Radix UI + Tailwind CSS

**Integration Questions:**
1. How do I add blog routes to the existing Wouter router?
2. Should I create blog components as lazy-loaded routes like the existing model pages?
3. How do I extend the Drizzle schema to add blog tables without breaking existing tables?
4. Can I keep using the same Vite config with `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer`?
5. Best practices for organizing blog code (separate `/blog` directory or integrate into existing structure)?

**I CANNOT migrate to Next.js/Remix/SvelteKit - the solution MUST work with the existing stack.**

### 2. **Tech Stack Recommendations (Blog-Specific Components)**
**Given the existing stack is locked, what should I use for blog-specific functionality?**

Options for blog-specific needs:
- **Rich Text Editor:** TinyMCE, Quill, Tiptap, Lexical, or markdown (SimpleMDE)?
- **Content Storage:** Database (existing PostgreSQL) vs. markdown files vs. headless CMS?
- **Image Management:** Cloudinary, Uploadcare, S3, or Replit file storage?
- **Search:** Client-side filtering, PostgreSQL full-text search, or Algolia integration?

Which components work best in Replit with React + Wouter + Express?

### 3. **Database Schema Extension (Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)**
**How do I safely add blog tables to the existing Neon PostgreSQL database?**

**Current Database Setup:**
- Neon serverless PostgreSQL (already provisioned)
- Drizzle ORM 0.39.1 (existing schema for assessment forms, leads, sessions)
- Database connection via environment variables

**Blog Schema Questions:**
1. How do I add new Drizzle schema files for blog tables (posts, categories, tags, authors, media)?
2. Can I run Drizzle migrations in Replit without affecting existing tables?
3. Best practices for foreign key relationships (posts ‚Üî categories, posts ‚Üî tags)?
4. Should I use UUID or auto-increment for post IDs in PostgreSQL?
5. How to handle database indexes for blog search/filtering performance?

**I'm already using Neon PostgreSQL - do NOT recommend switching databases.**

### 4. **File Storage for Images**
**How should I handle image uploads and storage?**

- Can I store images directly in Replit's file system?
- Should I use external storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3, Uploadcare)?
- What are storage limits in Replit?
- Can Replit handle image optimization (resizing, WebP conversion)?
- How do image uploads work with the existing Express backend?

### 5. **CMS Integration vs. Custom Build**
**Should I build a custom admin panel or integrate a headless CMS?**

**Option A: Custom Admin Panel in Replit**
- Build everything from scratch in the same Replit project
- Full control over features and UI
- Pros/cons in Replit environment?

**Option B: Headless CMS Integration**
- Use Contentful, Strapi, or Sanity
- Replit app only handles frontend + API integration
- Can I run Strapi directly in Replit, or should I use external hosting?

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Use markdown files in Git for content (MDX)
- Build simple admin UI to edit markdown files
- Deploy via Replit

Which approach would you recommend for maintainability and ease of use?

**Important:** Must work with existing React + Wouter + Express stack.

### 6. **Authentication & User Management**
**How should I handle admin authentication for the blog?**

**Existing Setup:**
- Express sessions with `express-session` + `connect-pg-simple` (PostgreSQL-backed)
- CSRF tokens via `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- Existing security measures (Helmet, rate limiting)

**Admin Auth Questions:**
1. Should I extend the existing session-based auth or add a separate admin system?
2. How do I create admin-only routes that integrate with Wouter routing?
3. Best practices for role-based access (Admin, Editor, Author) with Drizzle ORM?
4. Can I use the existing CSRF token implementation for admin panel forms?
5. Should I add 2FA/MFA for admin accounts?

What works best in Replit for securing an admin panel within the existing architecture?

### 7. **Deployment & Production Readiness**
**Can I deploy this blog infrastructure to production from Replit?**

- Can Replit host production traffic (expecting 500-2000 monthly visitors initially)?
- Should I deploy to Vercel/Netlify/Railway from Replit?
- What are the performance implications?

### 2. **NEON POSTGRESQL TIER REQUIREMENTS**

**My current database setup:**
- Using Neon PostgreSQL (likely Free tier currently)
- Current database: ~10-20 MB (assessment form submissions only)
- Current connections: ~5-10 concurrent (assessment form traffic)
- Current queries: ~100-200/day (form submissions + page loads)

**CRITICAL QUESTIONS:**

#### **Will Neon Free tier handle blog + assessment form?**
**Neon Free tier limits:**
- 10 concurrent connections
- 512 MB storage
- 1 GB data transfer/month

**Assessment:**
- Blog queries (read-heavy): ~50-100 connections/hour at 50K views/month
- Assessment form (write-heavy): ~10-20 connections/hour at 500 submissions/month
- **Total concurrent connections needed:** ?
- **Will Free tier's 10 connections suffice? YES/NO**

#### **Should I upgrade to Neon Pro ($19/month)?**
**Neon Pro includes:**
- 100 concurrent connections
- 10 GB storage
- Unlimited data transfer
- Point-in-time recovery (7 days)
- Database branching (test migrations safely)

**Questions:**
- At what traffic level does Neon Free tier become insufficient?
- What happens if I exceed 10 connection limit? (Site crashes? Requests queued?)
- Is Neon Pro required for production blog, or optional?
- Cost-benefit analysis: $19/month Pro vs. risk of connection errors

#### **Connection pooling implementation**
- How do I implement connection pooling with Neon serverless + Drizzle ORM?
- What's the recommended `maxConnectionsPerInstance` setting?
- Code example for `@neondatabase/serverless` with pooling?
- Will connection pooling prevent "too many connections" errors on Free tier?

---

### 3. **DATABASE MIGRATION SAFETY**

**CRITICAL CONCERN:**
- Assessment form submissions are production-critical (lead generation)
- Losing data or causing downtime = lost revenue + brand damage
- Cannot afford database corruption during blog migration
- Need absolute safest migration strategy

**CRITICAL QUESTIONS:**

#### **Neon database branching strategy**
- Should I use Neon database branching to test migrations first?
- Workflow: Create branch ‚Üí Test migration on branch ‚Üí If success, migrate production?
- Does branching require Neon Pro tier ($19/month)?
- How long does it take to create/delete a branch?

#### **Migration rollback plan**
- If migration fails halfway (e.g., creates 3 tables, fails on 4th), how do I rollback?
- Does Drizzle ORM support automatic rollback?
- Should I take manual backup before migrating? (Command: `pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql`)
- How do I restore from backup if needed?

#### **Safest migration command sequence**
Please provide exact commands for safest production migration:
```bash
# Step 1: Backup?
# Step 2: Test on branch?
# Step 3: Run migration?
# Step 4: Verify success?
# Step 5: Rollback if failed?
```

#### **Zero-downtime migration**
- Can blog tables be added without downtime to existing site?
- Will assessment form continue working during migration?
- Should I schedule maintenance window, or is migration instant?

---

### 4. **ADMIN PANEL AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY**

**My existing security setup:**
- Express sessions with `express-session` + `connect-pg-simple` (PostgreSQL-backed)
- CSRF tokens via `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- Helmet security headers (CSP, HSTS, noSniff, frameguard, XSS filter)
- Rate limiting (5000/15min strict, 100/5min SMS, 200/10min enhanced)
- Brute force protection (3 retries, 5-60 min lockout)

**CRITICAL QUESTIONS:**

#### **Should admin auth extend existing system or be separate?**
**Option A: Extend existing Express sessions**
- Add `role` field to session: 'user' | 'admin' | 'editor' | 'author'
- Reuse existing CSRF tokens
- Reuse existing rate limiting
- Pros/cons?

**Option B: Separate admin authentication**
- Create separate `/admin/login` with own session management
- Separate CSRF tokens for admin panel
- Separate rate limiting for admin routes
- Pros/cons?

**Your recommendation:** Which option is more secure and maintainable?

#### **Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation**
How to implement these roles with Drizzle ORM:
- **Admin:** Full access (create/edit/delete posts, manage users, settings)
- **Editor:** Edit all posts, publish/unpublish, manage categories/tags
- **Author:** Create/edit own posts only, submit for review

Code example for middleware:
```typescript
// Protect admin routes
function requireRole(role: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'author') {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    // Implementation?
  };
}
```

#### **Security considerations**
- Should admin panel be at `/admin` or `/en/admin` (language-prefixed)?
- Should admin routes be completely separate from public routes?
- 2FA/MFA recommendation for admin accounts?
- Should admin login have stricter rate limiting than public routes?

---

### 5. **TESTING & DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

**CRITICAL QUESTIONS:**

#### **How do I test blog features before deploying to production?**
**Option A: Replit dev environment**
- Use separate DATABASE_URL for development?

- Does Replit Core support separate dev/prod deployments?

**Option B: Neon database branches**
- Create branch for each feature (e.g., "blog-feature-xyz")
- Test against branch database
- Merge branch to production when verified

**Option C: Git branch workflow**
- Create git branch for blog development
- Test locally or in Replit
- Merge to main branch when ready

**Your recommendation:** Which testing strategy works best with Replit Core?

#### **Deployment pipeline**
**Current situation:**
- I push to GitHub (`https://github.com/CoachJuanGonzalez/illummaa2.git`)
- How does Replit Core deploy from GitHub? (Auto-deploy? Manual?)

**Questions:**

### 10. **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLEXITY & TIMELINE**

**You suggested 10-week implementation roadmap. Please validate:**

#### **Is this realistic for my skill level?**
**My background:**
- CTO/Technical Lead (full-stack developer)
- Comfortable with: React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM
- Experience: CRM architecture (GoHighLevel, HubSpot), n8n automation
- **However:** This is a complex bilingual blog with LLM/AEO features

**Questions:**
- Can I realistically build this in 10 weeks solo? Or should I hire developer?
- Which phases are most complex/time-consuming?
- Which phases could I outsource to speed up delivery?

#### **Dependency risks**
- Are there any blockers that could delay timeline?
- External service setup time (Cloudinary account, Neon Pro upgrade)?
- Learning curve for Tiptap, Drizzle migrations, Neon branching?
- Testing time (QA each phase before proceeding)?

#### **Minimum Viable Blog (faster launch)**
If I want to launch in 4-6 weeks instead of 10 weeks:
- What features can I cut from MVP?
- Which 2025+ features are "nice to have" vs. "must have"?
- Can I launch with English-only, add French later?
- Can I skip admin panel, manually add posts via SQL initially?

## Specific Implementation Questions

### Question A: Wouter Routing Integration
**How do I add blog routes to the existing Wouter 3.3.5 router?**

Current router structure in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<Route path="/" component={Home} />
<Route path="/models/1br-compact" component={Model1BRCompact} />
<Route path="/models/2br-family" component={Model2BRFamily} />
<Route path="/models/3br-executive" component={Model3BRExecutive} />
<Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
```

**I need to add:**
- `/blog` - Blog landing page
- `/blog/:slug` - Individual post page
- `/blog/category/:category` - Category pages
- `/blog/tag/:tag` - Tag pages
- `/blog/admin` - Admin panel (protected route)

**Questions:**
1. How do I structure these routes with Wouter?
2. Should I use nested routes or flat structure?
3. How do I implement route protection for `/blog/admin`?
4. Best practices for dynamic parameters (`:slug`, `:category`) with Wouter?

### Question B: Drizzle ORM Schema Extension
**How do I safely add blog tables using Drizzle ORM 0.39.1?**

Current setup:
- Using Drizzle ORM with Neon PostgreSQL
- Existing schema for: assessment forms, leads, sessions, brute-force attempts

**I need to add blog tables:**
```typescript
// Example schema structure
posts: {
  id: uuid or serial primary key,
  title: varchar(255),
  slug: varchar(255) unique,
  content: text,
  excerpt: varchar(300),
  author_id: integer (foreign key),
  featured_image_url: varchar(500),
  status: enum('draft', 'published', 'scheduled'),
  published_at: timestamp,
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp,
  meta_title: varchar(255),
  meta_description: varchar(300)
}

categories, tags, post_categories, post_tags, authors, media tables...
```

**Questions:**
1. How do I add new schema files without breaking existing tables?
2. What's the Drizzle migration command for Replit?
3. How do I handle many-to-many relationships (posts ‚Üî categories, posts ‚Üî tags)?
4. Best practices for indexes on slug, status, published_at for performance?
5. Should I use UUID or serial for post IDs with Neon PostgreSQL?

### Question C: Rich Text Editor Integration
**What's the best rich text editor for React + Wouter + Tailwind CSS?**

Options I'm considering:
- **Tiptap** (headless, React-friendly, extensible)
- **Lexical** (Facebook's editor, modern)
- **Quill** (mature, feature-rich)
- **TinyMCE** (powerful but heavy)
- **Markdown Editor** (SimpleMDE, EasyMDE - lighter weight)

**Requirements:**
- Must work with React 18.3.1
- Should integrate with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Need image upload capability
- Must support basic formatting (headings, bold, italic, lists, links)
- Prefer TypeScript support

**Questions:**
1. Which editor has the best React integration?
2. How do I handle image uploads from within the editor?
3. Can I style the editor with Tailwind CSS?
4. What's the best way to store the content (HTML, Markdown, or JSON)?

### Question D: Example Implementation for React + Wouter + Drizzle
**Can you provide a minimal working example for:**
- Adding blog routes to existing Wouter router
- Drizzle ORM schema for a simple posts table
- Express API endpoints for blog CRUD operations
- Basic blog landing page component (React + Tailwind)
- Individual post page component
- Simple admin authentication check

**Specifically for my stack:**
- React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.6.3
- Wouter 3.3.5 routing
- Express 4.21.2 backend
- Drizzle ORM 0.39.1 + Neon PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components

This would help me understand how to integrate blog functionality into the existing architecture.
