## URGENT FIX: SMS Consent Blocking Form Submission

**Issue:** SMS consent checkbox has a `required` attribute that blocks form submission when unchecked. This prevents the form from submitting and prevents the GHL webhook from being sent, even though SMS consent should be optional per A2P 10DLC compliance.

**Fix Required:** Remove the `required` attribute and update the text to show "(Optional)"

---

## FILE TO MODIFY

**File:** `client/src/components/assessment-form.tsx`

---

## CHANGE 1: Remove `required` Attribute (Line 2158)

**Find this code block (around line 2152-2160):**

```typescript
                  {/* SMS Consent */}
                  <label className="flex items-start gap-3 cursor-pointer group" data-testid="label-consent-sms">
                    <input
                      type="checkbox"
                      name="consentSMS"
                      checked={formData.consentSMS || false}
                      onChange={handleInputChange}
                      className="mt-0.5 w-4 h-4 text-indigo-600 rounded border-gray-300 focus:ring-indigo-500"
                      required
                      data-testid="checkbox-consent-sms"
                    />
```

**Change to:**

```typescript
                  {/* SMS Consent */}
                  <label className="flex items-start gap-3 cursor-pointer group" data-testid="label-consent-sms">
                    <input
                      type="checkbox"
                      name="consentSMS"
                      checked={formData.consentSMS || false}
                      onChange={handleInputChange}
                      className="mt-0.5 w-4 h-4 text-indigo-600 rounded border-gray-300 focus:ring-indigo-500"
                      data-testid="checkbox-consent-sms"
                    />
```

**What to do:**
- Delete the line containing `required` (line 2158)
- The result should have NO `required` attribute on the SMS checkbox

---

## CHANGE 2: Update Text to "(Optional)" (Line 2162)

**Find this code block (around line 2161-2163):**

```typescript
                    <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                      I consent to receive SMS text messages from ILLUMMAA for time-sensitive updates and project coordination. (Required for SMS compliance) <span className="text-red-500">*</span>
                    </span>
```

**Change to:**

```typescript
                    <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                      I consent to receive SMS text messages from ILLUMMAA for time-sensitive updates and project coordination. (Optional)
                    </span>
```

**What to do:**
- Replace `(Required for SMS compliance) <span className="text-red-500">*</span>` with `(Optional)`
- Remove the red asterisk completely

---

## VERIFICATION

After making the changes:

1. **Visual Check:**
   - SMS consent checkbox should show "(Optional)" without a red asterisk
   - CASL consent should still show "(Required) *"
   - Privacy Policy should still show "(Required) *"
   - Age Verification should still show "(Required) *"

2. **Functional Test:**
   - Fill out the partnership application form
   - On Step 5, check CASL consent, Privacy Policy, and Age Verification
   - Leave SMS consent UNCHECKED
   - Click "Submit Partnership Application"
   - Form should submit successfully WITHOUT showing a browser warning
   - Webhook should be sent to GHL

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Users can submit the form without checking SMS consent
   - No browser warning appears
   - GHL webhook is triggered
   - If SMS is unchecked: webhook does NOT include `sms_consent` field
   - If SMS is checked: webhook includes `sms_consent: true` and timestamp

---

## WHY THIS FIX IS NEEDED

**Current Problem:**
- HTML5 `required` attribute on SMS checkbox blocks browser form submission
- Browser shows "Please fill out this field" warning
- Form cannot be submitted without SMS consent
- This violates A2P 10DLC compliance (SMS must be opt-in only, not forced)
- Users who don't want SMS cannot complete the form

**What This Fix Does:**
- Removes browser-level validation blocking
- Allows form to submit without SMS consent
- JavaScript validation (line 1021) already correct - SMS is optional
- Backend mapping (routes.ts line 130) already correct - handles optional SMS
- Webhook logic (storage.ts line 421) already correct - conditionally includes SMS
- Only the frontend HTML required attribute was blocking the flow

**Security Impact:**
- ZERO - All security measures remain intact
- CSRF protection unchanged
- DOMPurify sanitization unchanged
- Required fields still enforced (CASL, Privacy Policy, Age Verification)

## SUMMARY

**Files to modify:** 1 file only
**Lines to change:** 2 lines only
**Changes:**
1. Remove `required` attribute from SMS checkbox (line 2158)
